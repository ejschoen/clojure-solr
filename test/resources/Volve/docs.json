Why the simple uniaxial strain model is\nphysically flawed but still gives relatively good matches to high quality\nstress measurements performed on several fields offshore Norway\n\nAndrews, J.S., and de Lesquen, C.\n\nEquinor, Stavanger, Norway\n\nCopyright 2019 ARMA, American Rock Mechanics Association\nThis paper was prepared for presentation at the 53 \n\nrd \n\nUS Rock Mechanics/Geomechanics Symposium held in New York, NY, USA, 23-26 June\n2019.

Profiles of\nminimum horizontal stress have been generated for several fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf based on the operator's\ndatabase of high-quality stress measurements. Standard methods are used to (straight-line) interpolate between measured points to\nprovide a \"continuous\" stress curve through the subsurface. A best practice is described on how to \"transfer\" stress measurements\nfrom nearby infill wells on each structure to the well of interest. An alternative approach uses the sonic log to estimate complete\nprofiles based on assumptions of elastic burial with uniaxial strain conditions. These profiles are then compared to the measured\nvalues. Despite there being many arguments against using the simple elastic uniaxial strain model for estimating stresses that have\ndeveloped over the course of many millions of years in geological processes that are often non-elastic in nature, a relatively good\nmatch is obtained by this method, especially in younger sediments. Potential mechanisms to explain this surprising result are\ndiscussed. An interesting suggestion is that it isn't the quasi static mechanical properties (Poisson's ratio) dictating the in-situ\nstresses but it is rather the in-situ stresses that dictate the undrained rock's (small strain) response. As such the Poisson's ratio (as\ndetermined from small strain, dynamic value typical during sonic logging and not during lab testing) is \"forced\" by the in-situ\nstresses present in the subsurface. The work presents a rare investigation when the veracity of the sonic stress method is compared\nto a database of many high-quality stress measurements. Even though a relatively good match for minimum stress is obtained in\nyoung sediments, some discrepancies are locally observed. This method should not replace dedicated stress measurements, but it\nmay help fill the gaps between the depths where such tests are normally performed (usually in competent claystone) and identify\npotential weak zones.\n\nGrail\" is thus to obtain a continuous stress profile\nthrough the overburden and the reservoir.\n1.

Models quantifying the risk of such debonding require the cement-caprock interface tensile strength as an input\nparameter. In this paper we present an experimental method to measure tensile strength of composite shale/cement plugs created\nunder stress and temperature conditions similar to downhole well conditions. We show that tensile failure always occurs at the\ncement/shale interface and that the interface tensile strength of typical caprock/cement bonding is usually significantly lower\ncompared to reservoir rock or cement bulk tensile strength. We discuss physical-chemical mechanisms underpinning the development\nof shale/cement interface tensile strength.\n\nmodified, split platens pressing on opposite half cross\n1.

The reaction of water with main cement\ncomponents results in precipitation of portlandite (CH)\nand so-called C-S-H phase. The main constituent of the\nhydrated cement, C-S-H phase is amorphous and is\nconsidered as a main binder in the hardened cement. It\ngrows in the form of interlocking needles that provide the\nstrength of the hydrated cement. CH is usually highly\n\nFig.5.

          "5::The hydration of C2S contributes largely to the final\nstrength of the hardened cement material.\nFigure 6 presents scanning electron images comparing the\ntopography of the nonexposed and exposed to cement\nshale surfaces. The pore spaces of the exposed surface\nare filled with C-S-H phase forming a characteristic\nreticular network. As cement particles cannot be squeezed\ndue to size exclusion into the shale pore matrix near the\ninterface, the development of the interface tensile strength\nobserved in the experiments must have been associated\nwith precipitation of CH and C-S-H phases only in the\npore spaces between cement particles residing at the shale\nsurface as well as shale pore spaces invaded by the cement\nwater (See schematic illustration in Fig. 7.). The interface\ntensile strength did not develop for the shale/cement\nsamples cured under atmospheric pressure (cement and\nshale cylinders separated after removing from the curing\ncell - data not shown). This may suggest that the invasion\nof water being in equilibrium with cement and the\npossible precipitation of CH, C-S-H phases inside the\npore spaces may play an important role in the\n\nFig.6.

Note the presence of reticular CSH phase filling the\n\natmospheric pressure only, osmotic pressure may drive\n\npore spaces at the surface exposed to the cement.\n\nwater residing on shale surface into the shale pore space.\nThis happens only when ionic strength of shale pore brine\nis higher than the ionic strength of water being in contact\nwith the surface. The surface then acts as a semipermeable\nmembrane allowing only water to pass through the\nsurface. When however axial stress is applied, water with\nsolutes (CH and C-S-H in case of water in equilibrium\nwith cement particles) invades pore spaces due to\nhydrostatic pressure. The solutes can be precipitated when\ntheir solubility threshold is reached. Fig.7. shows the\nproposed mechanism of tensile strength development at\ncement/shale caprock interface and contrast it with tensile\nstrength development mechanism in typical reservoir\nrock/cement system.\n\nFig. 7.

White pore spaces are not to scale with the size\nof cement particles.\n\nThe mechanical strength of the Portland cement is gained\nwith curing time. It can be expected that the tensile\nstrength of the interface also develops with the amount of\nbinders deposited in the pore spaces close to the shale\nsurface. However, due to time and equipment constraints\nour tensile strength tests were performed after 24 hours\nfrom the hydration onset. Nevertheless, for the bulk\nPortland cement (w/c 0.4) the empirical relation\nbetween the compressive strength (MPa) and curing time\n(days) at 50 C was established [23]:\nσ \n\nUCS\n\n 6.9977ln(t) 22.177 (3)\nThe compressive strength of bulk cement after 100 days\nof curing is approximately twice as high as the\ncompressive strength after 1 day of curing.
